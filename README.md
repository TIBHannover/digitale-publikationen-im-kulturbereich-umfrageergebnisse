Task Area 4 of the [NFDI4Culture](https://nfdi4culture.de/) is looking at which initiatives are enhancing their publications for open scholarship. Its aim is to establish a guideline for scholars to create publications and their associated data with a focus on long-term digital preservation.

In order to get a full understanding of existing enhanced publications in the NFDI4Culture community an online survey was conducted. Its aim was to gather further representative examples. The survey was also used to get a better understanding of what the NFDI4Culture community considers to be an enhanced publication and what features they associate with it.

The survey has shown a variety of examples and contexts which go beyond standard research publications or digital collections. In addition, it has shown that a term is needed, that can capture multimodal, multimedia and multilocal publications.
